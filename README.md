This project is a simple game where you play rock paper scissors against a randomly choosing computer. The computer keeps score on the console, however I am looking to show the score on the webpage in the future.
There is a 33% chance the computer chooses rock, paper, or scissors respectively.
This project was made to teach how to use javascript to listen for events that happen on an HTML page.
